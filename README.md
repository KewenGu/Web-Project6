The style of this assignment is simply a huge background with all element of the page aligned at the center with proprt margins.

All the functionalities are achieved using AJAX, including filtering the list, and adding to the list. The technical achievement I made for this assignement is an inline delete button for every element of the list, which is achieved using AJAX. When people click on the cross symbol on the side of a list item, it will be removed from list. 

The event handler in this file include showing a popup box when mouseover the title "Assignment 6". When click on the box, a movie trailer from youtube will be shown. When mouseover the title again, the video will be hidden. And when click on the title, the box will be hidden. I employed both bubbing and capturing propagation model.
